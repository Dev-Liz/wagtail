### 3.	Heroku
Heroku is another quick no-code option to set up the Wagtail Bakery on the cloud. Here are the steps:

- Sign up for a [free Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you don't have one already.
  
- Open a fresh tab with a copy of our [handy guide](https://wagtail.org/blog/try-wagtail-without-coding/) to trying Wagtail on Heroku.
 
 - Click the big green button below.

  - Follow the steps in our guide for some ideas on what to play with. Create a post or a page, add or destroy blocks, fill up the home page with bread puns (because they always rise to the occasion). This version of the Bakery is yours to play with until you delete it.
 
<br>

## Logging in
- Access the Wagtail login by adding `/admin` to the end of the URL in the bakery preview. <br>
https://wagtaildemo-nightly.herokuapp.com/admin

A login page will display like so:

- Log in with the username `admin` and password `changeme`.
  
- Welcome to the editor dashboard! Have fun playing around with Wagtail! Add a page, delete a blog post, replace the bread pictures with kittens. This site is your playground.
