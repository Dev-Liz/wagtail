# Wagtail CMS

Welcome to Wagtail User Guide! If you’re here, you probably already know that Wagtail is an open source content management system (CMS) created by Torchbox and supported by an international core team of developers. Wagtail is a great CMS for many websites because it is scalable and can be customised by developers relatively quickly and without too much fuss.

This guide is a collection of tutorials, how-to articles, reference guides, and explanations that will help you learn how to manage content in a standard Wagtail website. If you’re an editor, administrator, or general user of Wagtail, this guide is for you. If you’re a developer, you might find our developer documentation more useful.
